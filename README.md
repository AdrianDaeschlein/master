# Project Overview

Our project focuses on developing an advanced fall detection system that analyzes floor vibrations to detect and classify falls accurately. Falls among elderly individuals and vulnerable populations pose serious health risks, often leading to severe injuries and requiring immediate intervention. Our system is designed to provide real-time, non-intrusive, and highly reliable fall detection, ensuring timely alerts and minimizing false alarms.

By leveraging signal processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, our approach enhances fall detection accuracy while maintaining privacy and ease of integration. This work is part of our ongoing Masterâ€™s thesis research, aimed at improving the efficacy and reliability of fall detection in indoor environments.

# Challenge

The main challenge of this project is developing an accurate and reliable fall detection system, minimizing false positives and negatives. This requires overcoming data noise, optimizing real-time processing, and ensuring seamless hardware-software integration for effective and user-friendly deployment.
